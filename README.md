# GoTodoList

This app was created just for learning Golang ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.


## Build app

```bash
make
```

After building you get an executable file `go-todo-list`.


## Install app

```bash
make install
```

After this step will be created symlink `/bin/go-todo-list`.


## Uninstall app

```bash
make uninstall
```

Remove the symlink and `~/.go-todo-list folder` which is created after the first start of the program.
